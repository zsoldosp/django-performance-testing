.. contents:: Performance testing for Django through your automated tests!

Don't wait with performance testing until the end of the project! We have learned
already that more frequent feedback on smaller chunks of changes is much better,
e.g.: TDD, CI, DevOps, Agile, etc.

This library helps by providing performance testing from the start -
integrating it seamlessly into your existing development cycle, without
requiring changes to your development workflow.

Unlike regular performance testing tools (``ab``, ``tsung``, etc.), this
libary relies on indirect (proxy) indicators to performance - e.g.: the number
of queries executed. It's a good rule of thumb that the more SQL there is, the
slower it will be. And this way "performance" testing won't be slower than your
normal tests! (Disclaimer: while this tool is useful, classic performance
testing is still recommended!)


Setup
=====

* install it via ``pip install django-performance-testing``
* add it to your settings and it auto-registers itself
  ::

      settings.INSTALLED_APPS = [
         ...
         'django_performance_testing',
         ...
      ]

Usage
=====

* set your limits (see below for detail)
* and run your test ``manage.py test <your app>``

For any limit violations, there will be a test failure, and at the end, a
`Worst Items Report` will be printed.

Command line arguments
----------------------

* --no-report: Suppress output of report at end.

Supported Limits
================

Querycount
----------

Sets the limit in the number of queries executed inside the given scope.
Limits can be set for the ``total`` number of queries, or more specifically,
based on types of queries - ``read`` (``SELECT``), ``write`` (
``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``), and ``other`` (e.g.:
transaction (savepoints)).

When no (or ``None``) value is provided for a given limit type, that is 
ignored during the check, as if there were no limit rules for. Thus it's 
possible to only focus on no write queries, while ignoring all the other queries
that might be executed.

Time
----

Sets the limit on the ``total`` elapsed seconds.

Setting Limits
==============

Predefined limit points
-----------------------

Following are the keys that are currently supported for
``settings.PERFORMANCE_LIMITS`` dictionary

* ``django.test.client.Client`` - every call to its ``request`` method
  is limited, i.e.: ``GET``, ``POST``, etc.
* ``Template.render`` - every ``render`` call is checked for limits.
  Note: it's   recursive, i.e.: `include` and similar tags result in a check
* ``test method`` - the actual various ``unittest`` test methods that
  you write for your app

For each of the above keys, there is a ``dict`` that holds the actual limits.
The keys are the limit types (``queries`` and/or ``time``), and the value is
yet another ``dict``, holding the actual limit values. For valid values, see
the description of the limits above, or look at the sample settings

Sample Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    PERFORMANCE_LIMITS = {
        'test method': {
            'queries': {'total': 50},  # want to keep the tests focused
            'time': {'total': 0.2},  # want fast integrated tests, so aiming for 1/5 seconds
        },
        'django.test.client.Client': {
            'queries': {
                'read': 30,
                'write': 8,  # do not create complex object structures in the web
                             # process
            },
        },
        'Template.render': {
            'queries': {
                'write': 0,  # rendering a template should never write to the database!
                'read': 0
            }
        }
    }

Ad-Hoc Limits
-------------

While the built-in measurement points are great, sometimes, when profiling
and trying to improve sections of the code, more granular limits are needed.

Context managers for python/django code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All limits can be used as context managers, e.g.:


::

    from django_performance_testing.queries import QueryBatchLimit
    from django_performance_testing.timing import TimeLimit
    ...
    
    def my_method_with_too_many_queries(request):
        with QueryBatchLimit(write=0, read=10):  # initialize form
            form = MyForm(request.POST)
        with QueryBatchLimit(write=0, read=3):  # validate it
            is_valid = form.is_valid()
        if is_valid:
            with QueryBatchLimit(read=0, write=8):  # save it
                form.save()
            with QueryBatchLimit(read=0, write=0):  # redirect
                return HttpResponseRedirect(...)
        else:
            with QueryBatchLimit(write=0):  # render form
                with TimeLimit(total=0.01):   # we need superfast templates
                    return form_invalid(form)

Template tag for templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a single template tag that can be used after ``{% load djpt_limits %}``,
namely ``djptlimit``. It takes

* a single string positional argument, the name of the limit - as per
  ``settings.DJPT_KNOWN_LIMITS_DOTTED_PATHS``, see below
* keyword arguments that will be passed to the actual limit.

It can be used directly in your tempaltes like

::

    {% load djpt_limits %}
    {% djptlimit 'TimeLimit' total=3 %}
    {{ slow_rendering }}
    {% enddjptlimit %}

When debugging more complext template hierarchies, where e.g.: the slow part
might not even be our own template, then
```{{ block.super }}`` <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/templates/language/>`_
could be helpful

::

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block title %}
    {% djptlimit 'QueryBatchLimit' read=3 %}
    {{ block.super }}
    {% enddjptlimit %}
    {% endblock %}

``settings.DJPT_KNOWN_LIMITS_DOTTED_PATHS``
...........................................

This is an array of full class paths, similar to how
```settings.MIDDLEWARE`` <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/http/middleware/#activating-middleware>`
are defined, e.g.: ``['django_performance_testing.timing.TimeLimit']``.

The name of the limit is the classname part of the class.

Unless you have written a custom limit, this setting doesn't need to be set explicitly,
as the app has defaults that include all limits.

Release Notes
=============

* 0.4.0

  * add --no-report argument to disable output of performance report on shell

* 0.3.0

  * introduced ``django_performance_testing.core.limits_registry``. This keeps
    track of all limits, and enforces that across the django project all limits
    have unique names. This also warranted the introduction of
    ``settings.DJPT_KNOWN_LIMITS_DOTTED_PATHS``.
  * introduced ``djptlimit`` template tag to be used for ad-hoc template
    debugging

* 0.2.0

  * add timing measurement that can be limited
  * remove uniqueness check for ``collector.id_``, as the problems it caused
    for testing outweighed its benefit for developer debugging aid
  * backwards incompatible:

    * change how settings based limits are specified
    * change the worst report data output/data structure

* 0.1.1 - bugfix release

  * bugfix: attributes set by on test methods (e.g.: ``@unittest.skip``)
    are now recognizable again and not lost due to the library's patching

* 0.1.0 - initial release

  * supports Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 on python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5
  * query counts are reported and can be limited, by categories -
    ``read``, ``write``, ``other``, and ``total`` 
  * support ad-hoc limits by using it as a context manager
  * predefined limits support:

    * ``django.test.client.Client`` - all calls to its request method
    * actual ``unittest`` ``test_<foo>`` methods
    * ``Template.render``
